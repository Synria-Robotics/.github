**Shenzhen Synria Robotics Co., Ltd.**, founded in 2024 and headquartered in Shenzhen, China, is an innovative technology enterprise specializing in **embodied intelligence and teleoperated robotic systems**. The company focuses on the deep integration of **Teleoperated robots**, **End-to-end remote interaction solutions**, **Advanced control systems**, and **Next-generation multimodal embodied intelligence algorithms**. Our products are widely applicable in scenarios such as industrial automation, remote healthcare, and educational assistance. Key capabilities include **cross-domain remote operation**, **high responsiveness**, **fine manipulation**, and **multimodal perception**, enabling efficient human-robot collaboration in complex tasks.

The company’s technical architecture is built on five core pillars:

- **Remote and Wireless Teleoperation**: Enables low-latency, high-precision remote control across geographic boundaries, suitable for distributed task execution.  
- **Force Feedback and Tactile Interaction**: Provides haptic synchronization and force rendering during operation, enhancing controllability and operational safety.  
- **Ergonomics-Driven Design Philosophy**: Features wearable teaching devices designed according to ergonomic principles, closely matching natural human motion to improve operator comfort and control efficiency.  
- **Shared and Adaptive Control Mechanism**: Supports shared control between humans and robots with dynamically adjustable control authority, enabling efficient, safe, and intuitive collaboration.  
- **Multimodal Embodied Intelligence Algorithms**: Integrates vision, touch, and semantic perception to generate intelligent behavior in real-world environments.
